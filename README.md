# Master’s Thesis: Time-Varying Effects of Extreme Weather Shocks on Main Macroeconomic Indicators of Spain

## Overview
This repository contains the code developed for my Master’s Thesis, part of the **Master’s degree in Statistics for Data Science** at **Carlos III University**, 2023-2024. The thesis is titled:

**Time-Varying Effects of Extreme Weather Shocks on Main Macroeconomic Indicators of Spain**

This thesis explores the dynamic effects of extreme weather events, represented by the European Extreme Climate Index (E3CI), on key macroeconomic variables in Spain, such as GDP growth, inflation, and unemployment. Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregression (TVP-VAR) and Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) models are used to analyze these relationships.

## Repository Structure

- **`code/`**: Contains all R and Python scripts used to estimate the models, process data, and generate results.
- **`data/`**: Placeholder for datasets used in the analysis. Datasets may not be included due to size or confidentiality.
- **`results/`**: Will contain output plots and figures generated from the code, such as impulse response functions (IRFs).
  
## Important Note
This repository primarily focuses on posting the **code** used in the thesis work. The final thesis document, datasets, and extensive documentation may not be included here.
